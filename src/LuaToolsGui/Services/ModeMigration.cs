/// enum member, so "unparseable" is an exact synonym for "written by an older build". A user already
/// on Ost/Custom parses fine and is left completely alone, which is why no persisted
/// has-migrated marker is needed. This property is the entire reason the enum members are named
/// Ost/Custom: had <c>OpenSteamTools</c> been reused for the nightly channel, every legacy
/// stable-OST user would have silently parsed into the wrong mode, and the migration would have had
/// no way to tell those users apart from legitimate post-migration ones.</para>
